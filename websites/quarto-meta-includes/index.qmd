This is an example site to showcase the use of `meta` shortcodes for more precise includes using Quarto.

It accompanies the blog post at: <https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2024-12-20-includes-meta>

The pages for [New York](new-york.qmd) and [Pennsylvania](pa.qmd) are generated by including the same snippet:

````{.markdown filename="_snippets/facts.qmd" shortcodes="false"}
{{< meta state >}} covers approximately {{< meta square-miles >}} making it the {{< meta size-rank >}} largest state in the United States. As of 2023, {{< meta state >}} has an approximate population of about {{< meta population >}}.

{{< meta state >}}'s official flower is the {{< meta flower >}}, pictured below:

![The official {{< meta state >}} state flower, the {{< meta flower >}}](/images/{{< meta state-abbr >}}/flower.png)

Lastly, {{< meta state >}}'s official animal is the {{< meta animal >}}, pictured below:

![The official {{< meta state >}} state animal, the {{< meta animal >}}](/images/{{< meta state-abbr >}}/animal.png)
````

Where the relevant variables are set in each page's metadata, e.g.:

```{.yaml filename="new-york.qmd"}
