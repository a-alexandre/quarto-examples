Note, this is not fully working - see e.g. the legend background and the labels.

Although the plotly theming partly works, it [looks like heatmaply has a different way to get the rest of the theming right](https://github.com/talgalili/heatmaply/issues/82).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(heatmaply)
library(quarto)

light_theme <- theme_brand_plotly('light-brand.yml')
dark_theme <- theme_brand_plotly('dark-brand.yml')
```


```{r}
#| warning: false
#| renderings: [light, dark]

fig <- heatmaply(mtcars, k_row = 3, k_col = 2)

fig |> light_theme()
fig |> dark_theme()
```
