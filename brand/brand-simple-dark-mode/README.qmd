This is a simple example of using [**brand.yml**](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) across a range of Quarto supported formats with both a `light` and `dark` brand.

The project is a website with a homepage, `index.qmd`, that is rendered to multiple formats: `html`, `revealjs`, and `typst`, and a dashboard, `dashboard.qmd`.

Light and dark brand files are specified in `_quarto.yml`:

```{.yaml}
brand:
  light: _brand.yml
  dark: _brand-dark.yml
```

Where the `light` brand information is stored in `_brand.yml`:

```{.yaml}
{{< include _brand.yml >}}
```

And the `dark` brand information is stored in `_brand-dark.yml`:

```{.yaml}
{{< include _brand-dark.yml >}}
```
