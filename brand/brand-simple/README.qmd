This is a simple example of using [**brand.yml**](https://posit-dev.github.io/brand-yml/) across a range of Quarto supported formats.

The project is a website with a single document `index.qmd` that is rendered multiple formats: `html`, `revealjs`, `dashboard`, `typst`.


The brand information stored in `_brand.yml` is:

```{.yaml}
{{< include _brand.yml >}}
```

To preview locally, run:

```bash
quarto preview
```
